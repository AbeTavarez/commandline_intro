# Terminal Practice In Breakout Rooms

## Episode X: A New Terminal

> A long time ago in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the CLI commands introduced in Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.




### Setup

 1. Open the CLI/Terminal/GitBash
 2. Create another folder called: galaxy-far-far-away
 3. Then create a file inside galaxy-far-far-away called `commands.txt`
 4. Paste the answer to each numbered question (i.e. the command(s) that accomplished the task) in `commands.txt`, once you get it to work.
 5. Remember, use the README.md file to help you or use the --help flag: `ls --help`.


===========================================================
#### Part I: Set the Scene
Complete all work inside the galaxy-far-far-away folder.

- Create a directory called `death_star`, and make the following files inside of it: `darth_vader.txt`, `princess_leia.txt`, `storm_trooper.txt`.

 - In galaxy-far-far-away, make a directory named `tatooine` and create the following files in it: `luke.txt`, `ben_kenobi.txt`
Inside of `tatooine` make a directory called `millenium_falcon`, and in it create: `han_solo.txt`, `chewbaca.txt`.


===========================================================
#### Part II: mv - rename
You can rename a file using the `mv` command.

 - Rename `ben_kenobi.txt` to `obi_wan.txt`.


===========================================================
#### Part III: cp - copy
You can copy a file from one location to another using the `cp` command.

Directories can be sibling (parallel to each other) or can be parents (the folder that contains the folder you are in).

 - Copy `storm_trooper.txt` from `death_star` directory to `tatooine` directory.


===========================================================
#### Part IV: mv - move
You can use the `mv` command to move files from one location to another. `mv` can be used for renaming, moving, or both.

 - Move `luke.txt` and `obi_wan.txt` to the `millenium_falcon` directory.
 - Move `millenium_falcon` out of `tatooine` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`.
 - Move `millenium_falcon` into `death_star`.
 - Move `princess_leia.txt` into the `millenium_falcon` directory.


===========================================================
#### Part V: rm - remove
######WARNING: *BE CAREFUL WITH rm!!! THERE IS NO "TRASH" IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER!!!*

You can use `rm` to delete a file.

 - Delete `obi_wan.txt`.


===========================================================
#### Part VI: all together

 - In galaxy-far-far-away, make a directory called `yavin_4`.
 - Move the `millenium_falconout` of the `death_star` and into `yavin_4`.
 - Make a directory in `yavin_4` called `x_wing`.
 - Move `princess_leia.txt` to `yavin_4` and `luke.txt` to `x_wing`.
 - Move the `millenium_falcon` and `x_wing` out of `yavin_4` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`.
 - In `death_star`, create directories for `tie_fighter_1`, `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.
 - Move `darth_vader.txt` into `tie_fighter_1`.
 - Make a copy of `storm_trooper.txt` in both `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.
 - Move all of the `tie_fighters` out of the `death_star` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`.


===========================================================
#### Part VII: rm -r: remove directories and everything they contain
###### WARNING: *BE CAREFUL WITH rm -r THERE IS NO TRASH CAN IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER*

### Before you hit enter, make sure are deleting the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened). Check using `pwd`

###### This command will not typically ask you if you "really want to delete." It will just delete.

- Remove `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`.


===========================================================
#### Part VIII:
 
 - Touch or create a file in `x_wing` called `the_force.txt`
 - Destroy the `death_star` and anyone inside of it.
 - Return `x_wing` and the `millenium_falcon` to `yavin_4`.

##### Celebrate! You've reached the end of this exercise :)

===========================================================
#### You can skip this, I'll leave it here for later reference:
Commit and push your updated code:
"Add" your changes (prepare them to be "committed"):

$ git add -A
"Commit" your changesâ€”any time you make a commit, you can always restore the files in the repo to that point:

$ git commit -m "Completed lab"
"Push" your commits to github:

$ git push origin master
Conclusion
You will "git" plenty of practice as we progress through this program, so if the concept of git/github still seems a little fuzzy at this point, rest assured you will soon "git" it once you "git" some more practice in. ðŸ˜Ž
